This project highlights my solutions to the Advent of Code challenge.

## Setup
In order to run them you will need to register an account at Advent of Code.

I have not included input files into this repo. 

The solution will auto download the input file into the resources folder if it missing. 

In order to do this you will need to set an environmental variable "aoc_session" with your AOC session token.


# Run
To run, you can edit the main method in the Main class to the correct year and day.

Please note that not all days are present and/or complete
